# 2D Querynet
Inspired by the [deepsdf](https://www.groundai.com/project/deepsdf-learning-continuous-signed-distance-functions-for-shape-representation/)
I wanted to play around with the ideas of /auto-decoder networks/ and querying the point (pixel) that is to be reconstructed. 
I decided to do this in 2D with cifar10 instead of 3D as the inital paper but the elegance of this approach is that the dimensionality 
of the problem isn't hard coded into the soulution, in a way we can work in 2D with the exact same architectures as in 3D etc. That is cool!

## Auto-decoder

## Super-resolution

## Image-infilling
